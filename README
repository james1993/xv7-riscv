"xv6-riscv" is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

Refactoring changes:
- Ported to "2x" C standard
- Coding style follows mainline Linux, e.g. reverse Christmas tree, C-style comments, all variable declaractions at top of function, etc.
- Improved variable and function naming which removes the need for so many comments
- Static-ify applicable functions
- Trimmed down #includes
- More consistent design of files w.r.t. struct usage

Feature additions:
- Lottery scheduler for processes (done)
- System call tracing (done)
- New system calls: alarm, read counts, getpinfo, settickets (done)
- New user-level programs: sleep, pingpong (done)
- Kernel threads (in progress)
- Exceptions for null pointer dereferences (in progress)
- Changed the protection bits of parts of the page table (e.g. code) to be read-only (in progress)
